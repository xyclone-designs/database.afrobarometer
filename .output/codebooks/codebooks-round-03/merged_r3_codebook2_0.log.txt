Note: Answered by interviewer, after instructions, “It is your job is to select a random (this means any) household.  A household is a group of people who presently eat together from the same spot. Start your walk pattern from the start point that has been randomly chosen by your Field Supervisor.  Team members must walk in opposite directions to each other.  If A walks towards the sun, B must walk away from the sun; C and D must walk at right angles to A and B. Use the day code to determine the sampling interval.  For example, on the 5th, 14th and 23rd of the month, the day code (and sampling interval) is five.  So you choose the fifth dwelling structure on the right.  On the 6th, 15th and 24th of the month, the sampling interval is six.  So you choose the sixth dwelling structure on the right. And so on. If a call is unsuccessful, use the table below to record your progress until you make a successful call.  Circle a code number for unsuccessful calls only.”
