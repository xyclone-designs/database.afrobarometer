By merging this multi-country data into a single data set, we hope to facilitate cross-country analyses.  However, because Afrobarometer Round 1 emerged out of several different survey research efforts, meaning that survey instruments were not standardized across all countries, there are a number of particular features of the data set and the codebook that should be noted, as follows:  • In most cases, the data set only includes those questions/variables that were asked in nine or more countries.  Complete Round 1 data sets for each individual country have already been released, and are available from ICPSR or from the Afrobarometer website at www.afrobarometer.org.  • In the seven countries that originally formed the Southern Africa Barometer (SAB) – Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe – a standardized questionnaire was used, so question wording and response categories are the generally the same for all of these countries.  The questionnaires in Mali and Tanzania were also essentially identical (in the original English version).  Ghana, Uganda and Nigeria each had distinct questionnaires.  • This merged data set combines, into a single variable, responses from across these different countries where either identical or very similar questions were used, or where conceptually equivalent questions can be found in at least nine of the different countries.  For each variable, the exact question text from each of the countries or groups of countries (“SAB” refers to the Southern Africa Barometer countries) is listed.  • Response options also varied on some questions, and where applicable, these differences are also noted.
