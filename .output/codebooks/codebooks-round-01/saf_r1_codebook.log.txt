Note: Prior to question 5, the enumerator read the following passage to the respondent:  “People get their basic necessities of life such as food, safety, health care, or income in a variety of ways.  For instance, some people have to:  steal or beg for it, pretend they’re eligible for government assistance, or do a favour for, or bribe a government official.  Other people get these things from:  local traditional leaders, government relief programmes, local cooperative groups, or friends or family.  Still other people provide for it themselves, or pay for it in cash or in kind.  Finally some people are not able to get these things at all.” Respondent could give up to four answers.
