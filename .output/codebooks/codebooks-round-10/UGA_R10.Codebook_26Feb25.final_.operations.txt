We also ask users to send/email copies of any publications, papers, or reports that employ Afrobarometer data to Brian Howard, Afrobarometer’s head of publications, at bhoward@afrobarometer.org  Data Weights Afrobarometer includes four weights in our datasets. Two weights are used in all country-level datasets, and an additional two weights are used in our multi-country, merge datasets for each round. The withinwt_ea and withinwt_hh weights correct for over-and under-sampling at the national level. Each respondent is assigned a weight based on the inverse of their probability of selection, accounting for factors like geographical region and urban-rural distribution. The difference between the two withinwt variables is that while withinwt_ea accounts for enumeration population size, withinwt_hh factors in enumeration population AND household size, and is not available for earlier rounds of the survey.    In each merge dataset, we have two additional weight variables, combinwt_ea and combinwt_hh. These weight variables are based on the withinwt_ea and withinwt_hh variables, but they also standardise all national samples in the merge dataset so that each country has equal weight in the continental average.  In general, a weighting variable should be used when reporting national (withinwt_ea or withinwt_hh) or cross-national (combinwt_ea or combinwt_hh) results to ensure accuracy and reliability when making generalisations or drawing conclusions at the national level or multi-country level. For more information on Afrobarometer sampling protocols and weight construction, please visit our webpage   NOCALL Variables (Unit non-response)      In Afrobarometer surveys, interviewers record unsuccessful household calls as a “NOCALL”. Reasons for unsuccessful calls may include (but are not limited to) refusals to interview by the selected respondent or household members, absence of the randomly selected respondent, or respondents not meeting the selection criteria (citizens over the age of 18 who speak one of the survey languages). These NOCALLs are recorded as variables embedded in each successful case. If interviewers have five unsuccessful calls before a successful interview, users will find that NOCALL1 to NOCALL5 contain the reasons for the unsuccessful calls before the successful interview.   Non-response coding Afrobarometer utilises a standardised set of non-response codes across all questions and surveys. They are as follows: - Missing=-1 (no “system missing” data or empty cells) - Don’t know= 9, 99, 999 or 9999 - Refused to answer=8, 98, 9998 or 9998 - Not Applicable=7, 97, 997 or 9997 - No Further Response/Answer=96, 996 or 9996 - Not asked in country=9994  Computed variables: AB data sets include three computed variables that are Afrobarometer’s signature indicators of Lived Poverty, Demand for Democracy, and Supply of Democracy, each of which is described below.  Lived Poverty Index (LPI):  “As a contribution to the tracking of poverty in Africa, Afrobarometer offers the Lived Poverty Index (LPI), an experiential measure that is based on a series of survey questions about how frequently people actually go without basic necessities during the course of a year. The LPI measures a portion of the concept of poverty that is not captured well by other measures, and thus offers an important complement to official statistics on poverty and development (Mattes, 2008)”1.   The LPI is computed both as a raw average of the frequency with which respondents go without five basic necessities (Q7A-E), and as a categorial variable that groups respondents as experiencing no, low, moderate or high lived poverty.   The following syntax is used to generate these two variables (in .sps format).

Demand for Democracy (DemandDemo): DemandDemoI’ is a long-standing Afrobarometer indicator that combines explicit support for democracy (Q22) with rejection of all three non-democratic alternatives (Q21) – one-party rule, military rule, and strongman/one-man rule – using the following syntax:  RECODE Q21A Q21B Q21C (5=0) (4=0) (3=0) (2=1) (1=1) (9=0) (ELSE = SYSMIS) INTO q21a_r1 q21b_r1 q21c_r1  .

Supply of Democracy (SupplyDemo):       SupplyDemo combines the indicators of perceived extent of democracy (Q32) and satisfaction with the way democracy works (Q33) to provide a single indicator of the extent to which governments are supplying democracy to their citizens. The syntax is as follows:  RECODE  Q32 (1=0) (2=0) (9=0) (8=0) (3=1) (4=1) (ELSE=SYSMIS) INTO q32_r1. VARIABLE LABELS q32_r1 'how democratic is govt recoded, 0-1, dk=0'. EXECUTE.

Limitations of Afrobarometer Data Afrobarometer uses national probability sampling designed to generate a sample that is a representative cross-section of all citizens aged 18 and above. Samples usually include either 1,200 or 2,400 cases. A randomly selected sample of n=1,200 cases allows inferences to national adult populations with a margin of sampling error of +/-2.8 percentage points with a confidence level of 95%. With a sample size of n=2,400, the margin of error decreases to +/-2.0 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.  The margins of error will increase for sub-national groups (regions, demographic groups, etc.). While efforts are made to minimize nonresponse, some biases may exist if certain groups are underrepresented in the final sample.
