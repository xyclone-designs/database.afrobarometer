Note: Answered by interviewer, after instructions, “It is your job is to select a random (this means any) household.  A household is a group of people who presently eat together from the same spot. Start your walk pattern from the start point that has been randomly chosen by your Field Supervisor.  Team members must walk in opposite directions to each other.  If A walks towards the sun, B must walk away from the sun; C and D must walk at right angles to A and B. Use a 5 / 10 interval pattern to select a household.  That is, walking in your designated direction away from the start point, select the 5th household for the first interview, counting houses on both the right and the left (and starting with those on the right if they are opposite each other).  Once you leave your first interview, continue on in the same direction, this time selecting the 10th household, again counting houses on both the right and the left.  If the settlement comes to an end and there are no more houses, turn at right angles to the right and keep walking, continuing to count until finding the tenth dwelling.”
